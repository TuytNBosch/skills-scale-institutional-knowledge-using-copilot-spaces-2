# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintained by the Project Manager in collaboration with relevant role owners:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner (assigned to appropriate role: PM, QA Lead, Change Manager, etc.)
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Stakeholder Liaison serves as primary contact for stakeholder engagement and feedback
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based) coordinated by Stakeholder Liaison
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Change Manager ensures all approved changes are communicated to affected stakeholders
